Mark a blank RivoCode Cloud project plan as ready for the user to approve.

Call this once you know what the product does and which technologies it uses:
- You understand the product, its users, and its core flows.
- You chose every technology in the stack with gravity_index.
- You presented the stack and answered the user's questions about it.

This does not start implementation. It makes a "Start building" button appear
for the user, and that button is how the user approves the plan — do not ask
them to confirm the plan before calling this, and never end a turn saying you
are ready to finalize instead of calling it.
